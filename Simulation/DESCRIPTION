Title: A simulation study on violations of error distribution assumption in linear regression
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zeyu Li
Maintainer: Zeyu Li <lizeyu@umich.edu>
Description: This package simulates an assumption violation scenario in linear regression: the assumption that the errors are normally distributed is violated. In this scenario estimated coefficients are not necessarily invalid, but standard errors can be invalid and consequently leads to invalid inference. We examine the effect of this assumption violation through a simulation that takes parameters such as sample size, data-generating coefficient and parameters for error distribution.
