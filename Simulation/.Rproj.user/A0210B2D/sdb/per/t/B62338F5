In this scenario estimated coefficients are not necessarily invalid, but standard errors can be invalid and consequently leads to invalid inference. We examine the effect of this assumption violation through a simulation that takes parameters such as sample size, data-generating coefficient and parameters for error distribution. \nLicense: GPL-3\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\nimports:\n    rmutil\n    stringr \n    ggplot2\n    reshape2\n    gridExtra\nSuggests: testthat\n\n",
